# Here we would learn Match Case Statements available for python 3.10 onwards
# for example when we take input and use It with Match-Case Statement it will compare that input value with every case and exexute
# when a Particular Case Matches with input.
# it is just like if-else Statements when a case matches the ladder stops and statement under it executes.
# Basic Example
x=int(input("Enter marks Obtained Out of 100: "))
match x:
    case _ if x<33:
            print("Sorry u Failed")  # _ accepts any Value entered Unless that value matches with a previous case
    case _ if x>=33 and x<50:
            print("C Grade!!")
    case _ if x>=50 and x<70:
            print("B Grade!!")
    case _ if x>=70 and x<90:
            print(" A Grade !!")
    case _ if x>=90:
            print("A+ Grade!!")
